# Getting Started

This guide will help you get started quickly, whether you are here to **contribute your project** or to **find a project to work on**.

---

## 1. Finding a Project to Contribute To

Projects are organized by contribution level:

- [Beginner Projects](BEGINNER_PROJECTS.md)
- [Professional Projects](PROFESSIONAL_PROJECTS.md)

Browse through these lists and pick a project that matches your skill level and interest. Each project entry contains:

- Project name
- Repository link
- Short description
- Suggested areas of contribution

---

## 2. Submitting Your Project

If you have a [Python](https://python.org) project that needs contributors:

1. Open a **new issue** in this repository.
2. Choose the **Project Submission** template.
3. Fill in all required details:
   - Project name
   - Repository URL
   - Short description
   - Contribution level (Beginner or Professional)
   - Areas of contribution

Your submission will be reviewed automatically:

- If any information is missing, you will be asked to update it.
- Once complete, a pull request will be created to add your project to the appropriate list.

---

## 3. Contribution Workflow

- All submissions go through a validation process.
- Incomplete submissions are labeled `needs-info` and closed automatically after 7 days if not updated.
- Valid submissions are labeled `valid-submission` and added via pull request.
- Maintainers will review and merge the pull request.
